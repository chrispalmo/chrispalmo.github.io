      <description>tl;dr  It&amp;rsquo;s hard to underestimate the importance of typing. Unless you are a journalist, legal secretary, or professional writer, you probably don&amp;rsquo;t get enough practice to ever become truly fast. I built Typr and used it to simultaneously read &amp;amp; type &amp;ldquo;Surely You&amp;rsquo;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!&amp;quot;. Two weeks and 100,195 words later, I was maintaining between 100-110 WPM after starting out at 50 WPM. If you like reading, kill two birds with one stone by using Typr to practice typing material you would otherwise be reading.</description>
