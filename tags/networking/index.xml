      <description>I attended &amp;ldquo;Collaborate at RCL&amp;rdquo; last night, an event hosted by River City Labs, described as follows:
 What do you do when you have an amazing business idea, but you don&amp;rsquo;t have the skills or resources to make it happen? Help others with their ideas, and they&amp;rsquo;ll help you with yours!
That&amp;rsquo;s the idea behind Collaborate @ RCL. Meet some great people, learn some new skills, and work on some fantastic businesses - all at the same time.</description>
