      <description>I attended the first BrisJS meetup of the year last night. This was my first time attending a &amp;ldquo;programming language-centric&amp;rdquo; meetup, and I was surprised to find around 100 people in attendance. All presenters and the majority of the crowd looked to be in their 20&#39;s, and while the presentations didn&#39;t have the level of polish that I would usually expect for an event of this size, I was still able to learn a few things, and more importantly, have some interesting conversations with other developers about projects they are working on and opportunities in the market.</description>

      <description>I attended &amp;ldquo;Collaborate at RCL&amp;rdquo; last night, an event hosted by River City Labs, described as follows:
 What do you do when you have an amazing business idea, but you don&#39;t have the skills or resources to make it happen? Help others with their ideas, and they&#39;ll help you with yours!
That&#39;s the idea behind Collaborate @ RCL. Meet some great people, learn some new skills, and work on some fantastic businesses - all at the same time.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m Chris. This blog is where I write about what I&#39;m working on, what I&#39;ve learned, and what I&#39;m thinking about. It&#39;s a place to organise my thoughts and ideas in a place where other people might be able to find some value in it.
I currently live in Brisbane, Australia. I have worked as an engineering consultant and project manager, and have dabbled in sales. I also run an engineering tuition business.</description>
