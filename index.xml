      <description>This function takes an SQLAlchemy query object as it&#39;s input (SQLAlchemy is a popular Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper). It&#39;s strength lies in not needing to hard-code column names, making it scaleable and suitable to &amp;ldquo;set-and-forget&amp;rdquo;.
While developing enterprise software, every developer has surely have been faced with a client asking &amp;ldquo;how do I get the data out of the system?&amp;quot;, and after digging a bit deeper, it becomes clear they want the ability to save a snapshot of data as an Excel spreadsheet.</description>

      <description>If you do any software development in a Windows environment, you&#39;ll be spending enough time inside the Powershell (PS) console that it will be worth customizing the PS Profile to speed up your workflow.
The PS Profile is essentially a .ps1 script that is run whenever a new PS console is opened. Without going too deep into how a sysadmin might use it, the average developer will probably want to use it to quickly do a few basic things:</description>

      <description>You may have seen people walking around with those awkwardEat; Sleep; Code; Repeat; brogrammer shirts. I don&#39;t like them - between the many other things that developing software requires, when I actually sit down to write code the workflow would more accurately be described as Code; Compile; Google Error; Repeat;.
This short post explains how the below gg.ps1 Powershell script can increase your productivity by opening a chrome browser and executing a Google search straight from the Powershell console.</description>

      <description>Overview The following article describes how this blog is automatically deployed. The technology stack for this blog is:
 Source content written within the Hugo framework (a static website generator written in the Go language. Hosted by GitHub Pages, directly from this repository which contains the website build (the source code is in a separate repository). Cloudflare for cached content delivery (along with many other things).  If the technology stack for your project is completely different, this article should still provide you with:</description>

      <title>Event Review: BrisJS - Introducing the TypeScript compiler, Atomic Design, Scrutinising the norm</title>
      <link>/post/20200204-brisjs-meetup/</link>

      <description>I attended the first BrisJS meetup of the year last night. This was my first time attending a &amp;ldquo;programming language-centric&amp;rdquo; meetup, and I was surprised to find around 100 people in attendance. All presenters and the majority of the crowd looked to be in their 20&#39;s, and while the presentations didn&#39;t have the level of polish that I would usually expect for an event of this size, I was still able to learn a few things, and more importantly, have some interesting conversations with other developers about projects they are working on and opportunities in the market.</description>

      <description>I attended &amp;ldquo;Collaborate at RCL&amp;rdquo; last night, an event hosted by River City Labs, described as follows:
 What do you do when you have an amazing business idea, but you don&#39;t have the skills or resources to make it happen? Help others with their ideas, and they&#39;ll help you with yours!
That&#39;s the idea behind Collaborate @ RCL. Meet some great people, learn some new skills, and work on some fantastic businesses - all at the same time.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m Chris. This blog is where I write about what I&#39;m working on, what I&#39;ve learned, and what I&#39;m thinking about. It&#39;s a place to organise my thoughts and ideas in a place where other people might be able to find some value in it.
I currently live in Brisbane, Australia. I have worked as an engineering consultant and project manager, and have dabbled in sales. I also run an engineering tuition business.</description>
